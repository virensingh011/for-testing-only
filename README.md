# Aegis Atlas

Aegis Atlas is an independent STEM research build by **Viren Singh**. It is a browser-based project for exploring disaster maps, science simulations, document retrieval, reports, and safe threat-visualization demos.

It is intentionally framed as a **prototype / research build**. Some modules are simulated because the goal is to learn visualization, modeling, and frontend engineering rather than claim real operational intelligence.

## Features

## Developer Notes

- Built experimentally while exploring browser-based simulations.
- Designed as an independent STEM exploration project.
- Runs entirely client-side without backend infrastructure.
- Disaster and threat data are simulated for visualization experiments.
- The project avoids real cyberattack instructions and focuses on safe defensive/educational modeling.

## Learning Goals

- Learn browser-based simulation systems.
- Explore AI-assisted visualization ideas.
- Study interactive chemistry and physics models.
- Practice data dashboards, vector search, and document retrieval.
- Improve frontend architecture and GitHub Pages deployment skills.

## Deploy On GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repository.
2. Upload `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, and `README.md`.
3. Open repository **Settings**.
4. Go to **Pages**.
5. Set source to the main branch root.
6. Save, then open the published GitHub Pages URL.

## Optional Render Backend

The `backend/` folder contains a small Express API for Render. It proxies the live USGS earthquake feed and OpenWeatherMap weather data.

Set `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in Render before using `/api/weather`.

## Research Note

This project is a simulation and educational decision-support interface. It is not a substitute for official emergency alerts, government agencies, meteorological departments, humanitarian command systems, or real cybersecurity tools.
